# SMAT Sentiment Detector Demo

This work was commissioned by the Mozilla Foundation-funded project SMAT (https://www.smat-app.com/). I trained a lightweight sentiment detector on the hate speech dataset https://github.com/Vicomtech/hate-speech-datasetv using Pytorch and Huggingface's Transformers. A Google Colab notebook describing my methodology and demonstrating the performance of the model is available here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CHAo91WPjVKA0LG0VvGcuGvcYgtEs8wI?usp=sharing.
